# Movie Fare-android
An Android App to sell movie tickets based on dynamic pricing algorithm, that are used in flight tickets and app based cab services

## Idea 
Idea of this project came in existance when we saw more half of a movie hall is empty of a running movie, movie halls can sell their tickets in low pricing and fill their seats which were going to be empty and consumers can find a right price according to the movie 

## Backend 
The Backend of this app is in Node.js which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Rishabhk07/minor-backend).
Dynamic Pricing algorithms are applied on the Backend server
